# Understanding NetCDF Files for Spatiotemporal Datasets

NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a widely-used file format designed for the efficient storage and sharing of array-oriented scientific data, especially in the Earth and atmospheric sciences.

## üì¶ What is NetCDF?

NetCDF files store multidimensional data such as:

- Time series of satellite images
- Climate model outputs
- Oceanographic measurements
- Gridded environmental data

These datasets often span multiple **dimensions**, most commonly:
- `time`
- `latitude`
- `longitude`
- (sometimes `altitude` or `depth`)

---

## üß± Data Structure

NetCDF organizes data into variables and dimensions. Each variable (e.g., temperature, precipitation) is an N-dimensional array indexed by dimensions such as `time`, `lat`, and `lon`.

Below is a schematic illustration of a spatiotemporal dataset stored in a 3D NetCDF cube:

                              ‚Üë Time
                     +---+---+---+---+
                    / * / * / * / * /|
                   +---+---+---+---+ |
                  / * / * / * / * /| |

            | * | * | * | * | | | | +----‚Üí Lon

            +---+---+---+---+
            | * | * | * | * |/
            +---+---+---+---+
         ‚Üë Lat

Each "slice" is a 2D grid: Latitude √ó Longitude

> üó∫Ô∏è This cube represents one variable (e.g., temperature). Each horizontal slice is a 2D spatial grid at a specific time step.

---

## üìÇ File Components

A NetCDF file typically contains:

- **Dimensions**: Named sizes of axes (e.g., `time = 100`, `lat = 50`, `lon = 75`)
- **Variables**: Multidimensional arrays associated with dimensions (e.g., `temperature[time][lat][lon]`)
- **Attributes**: Metadata about the file or variables (e.g., units, description, source)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Structure

Here‚Äôs an example of what a NetCDF structure might look like:

netcdf example { dimensions: time = 12 ; lat = 180 ; lon = 360 ;

variables: float temperature(time, lat, lon) ; temperature:units = "Kelvin" ; temperature:long_name = "Monthly Mean Temperature" ;

float precipitation(time, lat, lon) ; precipitation:units = "mm" ; precipitation:long_name = "Monthly Total Precipitation" ;

double time(time) ; time:units = "days since 2000-01-01" ;

float lat(lat) ; lat:units = "degrees_north" ;

float lon(lon) ; lon:units = "degrees_east" ; }

---

## üìä Why Use NetCDF?

‚úÖ **Self-describing**: Contains metadata  
‚úÖ **Portable**: Platform-independent binary format  
‚úÖ **Efficient**: Supports compression and chunking  
‚úÖ **Widely Supported**: Tools exist in Python (`xarray`, `netCDF4`), R, MATLAB, C/C++, and more

```python
import xarray as xr

# Open a NetCDF file

# daymet2Raven_nc Function

The `daymet2Raven_nc` function is designed to process spatial climate data from the Daymet database and prepare it for use in the Raven Hydrological Modelling Framework. It generates a NetCDF file and grid weight information, integrating spatial data from a shapefile with gridded climatic variables.

# üì° Daymet Dataset Overview

Daymet provides high-resolution, gridded estimates of daily weather parameters across North America. These data are widely used in hydrological, ecological, and climate modeling.

## Function Overview

**Purpose:** Download Daymet climate data for specified locations, generate spatial data in NetCDF format, and create grid weight files necessary for hydrological modeling in Raven.

**Basic Usage:**

```r
daymet2Raven_nc(hru_shp_file,
                start_date,
                end_date,
                grid_size,
                lat = NULL,
                lon = NULL,
                HRU_ID = "HRU_ID",
                outdir = getwd(),
                plot = T)
```

**Parameters:**

- **`hru_shp_file`**: Path to the shapefile representing the hydrological response units (HRUs).
- **`start_date`**: The starting date for data retrieval in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- **`end_date`**: The ending date for data retrieval in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- **`grid_size`**: Desired size of the grid cells in decimal degrees.
- **`lat`**: required when `"grid_size"` has not been provided. A vector of latitude(s) where data are collected.
- **`lon`**: required when `"grid_size"` has not been provided. A vector of longitude(s) where data are collected.
- **`HRU_ID`**: Column name in the shapefile that contains unique HRU identifiers (default is `"HRU_ID"`).
- **`outdir`**: directory where the output files go there, default is set to the currect directory.
- **`plot`**: logical, whether to plot the grid cells overlied by the `"hru_shp_file"`.

**How It Works:**

1. **Shapefile Processing:** Reads and transforms the input shapefile to a valid spatial format, then simplifies and buffers the boundary to create grid cells.

2. **Data Retrieval:** Downloads daily minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation data from the Daymet database for each grid cell.

3. **NetCDF Creation:** Organizes the retrieved climate data and altitude information into arrays. Writes the arrays into a NetCDF file with appropriate metadata.

4. **Grid Weight Calculation:** Intersects grid cells with HRUs to calculate area-based weights and writes the grid weights into a text file for Raven.

5. **Metadata Logging:** Generates metadata files containing the configuration of grid forcings and other relevant information.
