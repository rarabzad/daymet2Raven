# daymet2Raven_nc

The `daymet2Raven_nc` function is designed to process spatial climate data from the Daymet database and prepare it for use in the Raven Hydrological Modelling Framework. It generates a NetCDF file and grid weight information, integrating spatial data from a shapefile with gridded climatic variables.

## Function Overview

**Purpose:** Download Daymet climate data for specified locations, generate spatial data in NetCDF format, and create grid weight files necessary for hydrological modeling in Raven.

**Basic Usage:**

```r
daymet2Raven_nc(hru_shp_file, start_date, end_date, grid_size, HRU_ID="HRU_ID", nc_file="RavenInput.nc", grid_weight_file="weights.txt")
```

**Parameters:**

- **`hru_shp_file`**: Path to the shapefile representing the hydrological response units (HRUs).
- **`start_date`**: The starting date for data retrieval in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- **`end_date`**: The ending date for data retrieval in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- **`grid_size`**: Desired size of the grid cells in decimal degrees.
- **`HRU_ID`**: Column name in the shapefile that contains unique HRU identifiers (default is `"HRU_ID"`).
- **`nc_file`**: The name of the output NetCDF file (default is `"RavenInput.nc"`).
- **`grid_weight_file`**: The name of the output file where grid weights will be saved (default is `"weights.txt"`).

**How It Works:**

1. **Shapefile Processing:** Reads and transforms the input shapefile to a valid spatial format, then simplifies and buffers the boundary to create grid cells.

2. **Data Retrieval:** Downloads daily minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation data from the Daymet database for each grid cell.

3. **NetCDF Creation:** Organizes the retrieved climate data and altitude information into arrays. Writes the arrays into a NetCDF file with appropriate metadata.

4. **Grid Weight Calculation:** Intersects grid cells with HRUs to calculate area-based weights and writes the grid weights into a text file for Raven.

5. **Metadata Logging:** Generates metadata files containing the configuration of grid forcings and other relevant information.

## Installation

To use this function, ensure you have the following R libraries installed:

- `daymetr`
